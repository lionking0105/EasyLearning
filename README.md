## Description:
----
EasyLearning was an idea to face our final project at Henry Bootcamp. It consist in a E-learning web app where the user can not only buy, but also create and sell their own courses. It has a register system. Also, you can login with your Google account.
To teach at EasyLearning your courses must be approved by the admins, after verifying that they comply whit the pageÂ´s rules.
